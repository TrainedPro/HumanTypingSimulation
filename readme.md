# Human Typing Simulation
This file contains the Python code used for a skit that demonstrated software engineering principles. The skit was about a group of software engineers who were trying to build a chatbot that could answer questions about Pakistan.

## How To Use
Enter any string into the `fake_typing` function and it will slowly display it. You can change the `multiplier`to make it faster or slower according to your needs.
